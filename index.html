<h2><b><u> Traits and Personality 
  <center><p><img src="Screenshot 2018-01-05 at 8.38.18 AM.png"> </center></p></b></u></h2>
 <p style="text-indent: 40px">Finnegan is a very lively dog, and loves everyone. He can't go one day without his ball, in which he is crazy about and will chase it to the end of the world, even if it means chewing or scratching an obsticle.
  Also, when Finn catches his ball he comes back proud and prancing, and sometimes will even shove it into your face. Speaking of which, he loves to steal your socks, and store them in his kennel with his other toys.
  Because we taught Finn many tricks, he learned that when he barks or growls you'd eventually throw the ball, and if you don't he'll get louder and louder until you do.
  Try not to get Finn mad because he grunt angeredly, growl, and even bark...He is a fierce dog. And, when things don't go his way he finds a way to make him happy. 
  Such as when he wants to sleep in his kennel and forgets that he stuffed things in there, and when his bed doesn't feel nice he grunts, growls and using his paws tries to make things better by moving them.</p>
