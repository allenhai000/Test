<h2><b><u> Traits and Personality 
  <center><p><img src="Screenshot 2018-01-05 at 8.38.18 AM.png"> </center></p></b></u></h2>
 <p style="text-indent: 40px">Finnegan is a very lively dog, and loves everyone. He can't go one day without his ball, in which he is crazy about and will chase it to the end of the world, even if it means chewing or scratching an obsticle.
  Also, when Finn catches his ball he comes back proud and prancing, and sometimes will even shove it into your face. Speaking of which, he loves to steal your socks, and store them in his kennel with his other toys.
  Because we taught Finn many tricks, he learned that when he barks or growls you'd eventually throw the ball, and if you don't he'll get louder and louder until you do.
  Try not to get Finn mad because he grunt angeredly, growl, and even bark...He is a fierce dog. And, when things don't go his way he finds a way to make him happy. 
  Such as when he wants to sleep in his kennel and forgets that he stuffed things in there, and when his bed doesn't feel nice he grunts, growls and using his paws tries to make things better by moving them.</p>

<h2><b><u> Back Story
<center><p><img src="Screenshot 2018-01-05 at 8.41.16 AM.png"> </center></p></u></b></h2>
  <p style="text-indent: 40px"> Before Finnegan became our dog, he was a victim to abandonment. In California high kill shelters stationed all over control the rates of
  dogs that run away, get abandonded, and owners who leave their pet behind. Finn was one of these dogs, he was found at a high kill shelter
  in California and was baught and brought up in a truck with a bunch of other dogs to Washington, rescued by Ginger's Pet Rescue. When my mom found the ad for him...we knew he
  would be the perfect pet, and ultimately we were the first to put in for an interaction/meet up with Finnegan. It was like love at first sight, but we 
  knew that he wasn't in the best of shape. When we brought him home for the first time,Finn was extremely sick and skinny. Then, a few
  days after adopting him he had a bad episode of extremely gross things...worms. We immediately took him to the vet where he was vaccinated and dewormed.
  And then, the road to recovery went extremely well, he eventually came out of his shell of being a shy dog and loved to be with my whole family</p>
